Pandas E-Commerce Analysis (Superstore Project)

This project is my full breakdown of the “Sample Superstore” dataset using Pandas. It’s meant to show that I know how to work with real 
business-type data the same way companies do — merging tables, creating time-based features, grouping, pivoting, ranking, and exploring trends.

I converted all the order dates into proper datetime format, created new columns like month, quarter, year, and even “days since first purchase” 
to treat the dataset like a real timeline. From there, I explored sales patterns by month, profit by product category, average discounts by region, 
and other insights.

I also generated a second simulated customers dataset and merged it with the main one, which is something almost every real ML or analytics 
project uses. After that, I built pivot tables and ranked top-selling products and states.

Overall, this project shows that I can take a messy business dataset and turn it into something structured, meaningful, and ready for machine 
learning or deeper analytics.
