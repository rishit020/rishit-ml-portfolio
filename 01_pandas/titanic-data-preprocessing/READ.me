This project is my hands-on walkthrough of cleaning and analyzing the Titanic dataset using Pandas. My goal here was to show that I can 
take a messy real-world dataset, fix the missing values, engineer new features, and run meaningful analysis on it. This is the type of 
data prep you’d do before training any machine learning model.

I handled missing values (mean/mode), removed unusable columns, filtered specific groups of passengers, created new features like 
family size and age groups, and used groupby to explore survival patterns across class, sex, and embarkation town. I also included some 
basic visualizations to show patterns in survival rates.

Overall, this project shows that I understand the core data cleaning workflow in Pandas and can turn raw data into something usable for 
machine learning or deeper analysis.
