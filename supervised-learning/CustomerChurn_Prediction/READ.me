# Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression and SMOTE

This project implements a complete supervised machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**. The notebook demonstrates an end-to-end workflow, covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and interpretability.

The primary objective is to accurately identify customers likely to churn while addressing class imbalance and maintaining strong generalization performance.

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a common business problem where the goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue a service. In this project, churn is framed as a **binary classification task** and evaluated primarily using the **F1-score**, which balances precision and recall under class imbalance.

The final model is a **regularized Logistic Regression classifier** trained within a robust pipeline that includes preprocessing, **SMOTE-based oversampling**, and **cross-validated hyperparameter tuning**.

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source**: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
* **Target Variable**: `Churn`

  * Yes → 1
  * No → 0
* **Feature Groups**:

  * Demographics
  * Account information
  * Service usage
  * Billing and contract details

Missing values and inconsistent categorical encodings are handled automatically as part of the preprocessing pipeline.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Dropped non-informative identifiers
* Converted numeric fields with invalid entries
* Unified categorical service indicators
* Engineered additional features:

  * Total number of subscribed services
  * Tenure grouping

### 2. Train–Test Split

* Stratified split to preserve churn distribution
* 80% training, 20% testing

### 3. Pipeline Design

* **Numerical features**:

  * Median imputation
  * Standard scaling
* **Categorical features**:

  * Most-frequent imputation
  * One-hot encoding
* **Class imbalance handling**:

  * SMOTE applied *within* the training pipeline

### 4. Model Training and Tuning

* Logistic Regression with L1/L2 regularization
* Hyperparameters optimized using `GridSearchCV`
* 5-fold cross-validation
* Optimization metric: **F1-score**

## 📈 Model Performance

| Metric   | Train | Test  |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| F1-Score | ~0.63 | ~0.62 |

The close alignment between training and test performance indicates minimal overfitting and stable generalization.

## 📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes the following evaluation and interpretability visualizations:

* Confusion Matrix heatmap
* ROC Curve with AUC
* Precision–Recall Curve
* Feature coefficient importance plot
* Threshold sensitivity analysis (optional)

These plots provide insight into both predictive performance and the factors most strongly associated with customer churn.

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Contract type, tenure, and service adoption are strong drivers of churn
* Logistic Regression provides competitive performance while remaining interpretable
* SMOTE significantly improves recall without destabilizing precision
* Default probability thresholds are not always optimal for business objectives
