# NumPy Statistics & Encoding Project

This project focuses on rebuilding important data-processing steps using only NumPy. 
I generated a random dataset, calculated key statistics (mean, median, mode), normalized the data with Z-scores and min-max scaling, 
created one-hot encodings from scratch, and computed a full correlation matrix using matrix operations.

I built everything manually to understand how these operations actually work under the hood before moving into pandas, 
scikit-learn, and eventually deep learning. This project shows that I can handle the core data manipulation skills that real 
machine learning workflows depend on.
